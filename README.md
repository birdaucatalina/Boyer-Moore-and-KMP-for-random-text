# Boyer-Moore-and-KMP-for-random-text

This implementation represents the following requirements of the section "Experiments" from the book "Algorithms", 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne:

5.3.37 KMP for random text. Write a client that takes integers M, N, and T as input and
runs the following experiment T times: Generate a random pattern of length M and a
random text of length N, counting the number of character compares used by KMP to
search for the pattern in the text. Instrument KMP to provide the number of compares,
and print the average count for the T trials.

5.3.38 Boyer-Moore for random text. Answer the previous exercise for BoyerMoore.
